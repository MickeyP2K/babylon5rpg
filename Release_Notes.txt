Version 1.0.3
Removed the Add Item button from the Inventory page as it's confusing. Items, weapons etc. should be created from the Item tab then dragged to the character sheet.  
Corrected an error with the dice rolling mechanic.  
Push rolls now show total successes from both rolls.

Known issues: 
Weapon rolls on the vehicle template do not work correctly because there is no Ranged Combat attribute which should be derived from the operator (actor).  
I am considering the best way to fix this.   

Version 1.0.4
Added a "Rounds" text box to the Weapons template to allow the player to keep track of ammo.
Added the table roll number to the chat output for stress rolls.
Added prompt for Permanent Trauma to the chat message when the roll is >= 13.
Skills now show the controlling attribute.

Corrected error with sucess totals for supply rolls.

Version 1.0.9
Corrected error with wrong attributes assigned to some skills.

Version 1.1.0
PDFoundry is no longer bundled with Babylon5RPG so if you have been using this feature please make sure you install the fantastic

"More Panic" mechanics implemented.  Unchecking the "Panicked" condition will reset the panic level to zero.

Added a better looking panic button.
Added the ability to add Stunt descriptions on the Skills tab.  Toggling the spanner icon will display the text (like Talents).

You just need to open each skill and edit the text with the Stunts from the rule book.
Updated "Mother Instructions".       

Version 1.1.6
System should now work with Foundry V0.7.3
Added an NPC check box to the Character and Synth sheets only visible to the GM.

Unchecking the NPC box will not affect existing tokens.  

Version 1.1.7 - Bug fix
In my eagerness to get the dice system working with FVTT V0.7.3 I broke the dice rolling for V0.6.6 !

Version 1.1.8
Dragging Creatures on to a Scene now sets them to unlinked as well as hostile.

Version 1.1.9 - Bug fix

always appear on the first opened sheet.  Thanks to Kribby-D#3747 for making me aware of the issue.

Version 1.2.8
Backed out package loaded fonts as "The Forge" tries to get hem from the Bazaar rather than the defined source location.

Added Chinese language translation with thanks to Tian#7972
Added German language translation with thanks to Raldanash#6529
Add a context sensitive menu to items lists.  Right click on the edit icon to get edit or delete options.

Stress roll mod (right click) now only allows stress dice to be added or subtracted.

Consumable boxes now total the type for multiple Items so show total Air, Food, Water and Power.  
- Checks can be rolled to test for depletion and failures are removed from the Active item(s) sheet.  
 - Note: This is sequential so once an item is depleted it will just move on to the next available Active item with that resource.

Tidied up the systems list presentation on the Territories sheet.

Version 1.2.12
Corrected error with the system triggering the migration script when it was not needed. Sorry folks! 

Version 1.2.13
Corrected another bug with Skill-Stunts not displaying properly.
GM's NOTE: Set the user permissions of the Skill-Stunts folder to "All Players" None.  
This will still allow the pop up to appear but will prevent players from dragging the skills on to their Actor which corrupts the data.

Version 1.2.14
Corrected bug with the description not displaying correctly on Character and Synthetic sheets.  

Version 1.2.15
Corrected bug with the description not displaying correctly on Creature sheets.  

Version 1.2.16
Fixed the issue with Skill-Stunts corrupting Character sheets preventing rolls. 
GM's NOTE: Set the user permissions of the Skill-Stunts folder to "All Players" None.  
This will still allow the pop up to appear but will prevent players from dragging the skills on to their Actor which corrupts the data.  

Version 1.2.17
Improved Chinese language translation with thanks to Tian#7972
Added stress and Health bars for Tokens (Stress at the top, Health at the bottom).

Version 1.2.18
Update to Stress and dice rolls as I was using 'd6' in my scripts which is no longer supported in FVTT V0.7.8

Creature templates now have Health X/X for current/max which allows the token bar to operate properly.

Version 1.2.21
Added a new Item type of Agenda.  This will display on the character sheet like Talents.
The idea is that the GM can create "secret" agendas for the players put them in a Compendium and make it visible only to the GM.  
The GM can then drop the appropriate Agenda item on the PC sheet so they can see it.  

Version 1.2.23
Removed message to roll multiple stress dice when more than one facehugger is rolled.
Added Armor Vs Fire attribute to the Creatures sheet as Xenos have different Armor against fire damage.
