# Babylon 5 RPG 

An UNOFFICIAL system for playing Babylon 5 on Foundry VTT.

My intention is to enable people to play Babylon 5 RPG using what I beleive to be a far superior game system for this setting. 

To fully use this game system you will need to purchase a copy of the Aliens RPG rules from Free League Publishing: https://frialigan.se/en/games/alien/

### System Version

This is community created game system to run Babylon 5 games on virtual table top platforms.

Please Note:

- If you find any issues or have any feedback please let me know.

### VTT Support:

Tested with the following virtual table top platforms:

- v0.7.9

### Note: Dice so Nice is no longer required for this system but it fully supports DsN and is recommended:

- Foundry VTT Dice So nice https://gitlab.com/riccisi/foundryvtt-dice-so-nice.
